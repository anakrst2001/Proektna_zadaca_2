            <p>If you've seen Friends way too many times just as me, you are likely to be interested
                in joining this discussion. This question remains interesting and open to interpretation
                many years after it was first asked. So, are you team Ross or team Rachel on this one?

            <p>If Karate Kid is also your all time favourite movie, you might have asked yourself 
                who is actually the real bully in this 80s classic. Was it really Johnny? Or did 
                Mr Miyagi's student do some pretty inexcusable things to Johnny as well?
                Let us know!

            <p>Fans of this movie might argue that Daniel won fair and square in the famous karate tournament.
                But was this really the case? Should Daniel have been disqualified because the crane kick to the head 
                was illegal? Discuss in the comments section!

            <p>Given Kreese's history shown in the popular TV series, fans start to wonder if deep down
                Kreese is not actually a bad person. But does he actually deserve forgiveness for his actions because of his redemption arc
                or will he fool us again into thinking this and do the unexpected?

            <p>Karate Kid has taught me many life lessons and therefore is my favourite movie.

                    <li>It's okay to lose to opponent. It's never okay to lose to fear.</li>
                    <li>For a man with no forgiveness in his heart, life is a worse punishment than death.</li>
                    <li>A lie becomes the truth only if people want to believe it.</li>
                    <li>Never put passion in front of principle. Even if you win, you'll lose!</li>
                    <li>You should trust the quality of what you know, not the quantity.</li>
                    <li>First learn how to stand, then learn how to fly.</li>
                    <li>If it comes from inside of you, it's always the right one.</li>
                    <li>There's no such thing as a bad student, there's only a bad teacher.</li>
                </ul>
